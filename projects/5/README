Project Conclusion:
The eventual goal of this game will be to out survive the other birds. A high score will be kept track of.
I will incorporate a health bar, which will go up when bugs are consumed, but decrease as time goes on
without eating bugs. Additionally, there will be other "dark" eagles that try to eat the bugs and will attack
the player within a certain range. These Eagles will also have health bars, but the player will not be able to
see them. Some of the dark eagles may be "stronger" than others too, larger health bars. Again, the goal of the
game is to out survive the other birds, aka the dark eagles and the other bird that don't attack but do try to
eat bugs.
