Project Conclusion:
The goal of this game is to kill all the other birds before your health runs out. You move with AWSD, you shoot with I, you can toggle the menu with M, and restart with R.
To regain health an occasional red heart will appear. To win easily, toggle the menu and select God Mode. This will give you infinite health. Additionally, you can make the game harder by
changing the level or increasing the number of sprites manually.

Pizzaz:
To add Pizzaz, I made a menu. The menu has four options when you toggle it: 1)Go Back to Game, 2)Add Sprites, 3)Set Difficulty, 4)Toggle God Mode. The 3) option loads another menu to allow a player to select their game difficulty. I changed Dr.Malloy's light bulb to sunshine too :).
