Project description:

The purpose of this project was to help me become better familiar with C++ language constructs, design patterns, data-driven programming, and a tracker framework. I used parallax scrolling to make a scene from Zion national park. I made a boulder sprite, a windspinner multisprint, and a eagle two way multisprite.

What sprite did I repeat at least 7 times?
I repeated my boulder sprite and my windspinner multisprite 7 times each.

What sprite (not Sprite or MultiSprite) did I design?
I designed a two way multi frame sprite that is a plump eagle.

The easiest part of this project:
Getting the tracker frame work up and running.

Problems that I had in completing this project
I struggled with understanding the singleton pattern variations, and I struggled with making edits tomy eagle and wind spinner sprites.
