Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)

I drew a molecule of DNA with the nucleotide base pairs (adenine,thymine,guanine, and cytosine) to be identified by four different colors and the basic
outline of their chemical structure as purine and pyrimidine rings

The easiest part of this project:
Having Fun :) and applying some biochem knowledge

Problems that I had in completing this project:
I had to refresh myself on basic trig and I had to figure out how to rotate shapes. I didn't
get the shapes to quite line up on the purine rings, but I hope to build on this idea in
later projects.
